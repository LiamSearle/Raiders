- i dont think the clients booking (where the client enters their info) page needs a navigation bar
- maybe calling the bookingreq.php page homepage would make more sense
- there is a little gap between to the left of the navigation bar and its annoying me so so much
- navigationalbar.html like our demo file to check things
- index.html maybe two buttons client or admin??
- raiders.php not centered
- why have a search bar what will it do?
- client tab should go to returningAndNewClient.php
- LogOut button issues? cant move it more to the left
- doesn't make sense the table on returning and new client page because the driver wont be assigned and stuff 
- when you click bookings now takes you too the adminNewBookingPage that Liam created
- after you logged out and redirected to the raiders.php page maybe something at the top saying sucessfully logged out?
-change logout button to the far right 
-create an actual sign up page so that it can dynamically insert new members into the database. This will then attach the user credentials to creating a new booking

* might have to create an admin details table to keep track of employee details
* table would help HR keep track of employee details
* it must assign an employee with an employeeID
* still busy with adminHR page- must create report page

Tshego
* employees tables
*CREATE TABLE `employees` (
  firstName varchar(50), 
  lastName varchar(50), 
  dateofbirth (date), 
  ID UNIQUE tinyint (10), 
  emailAddress varchar (20), 
  contactNumber unique tinyint (10),
