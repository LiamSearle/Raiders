- i dont think the clients booking (where the client enters their info) page needs a navigation bar
- there is a little gap between to the left of the navigation bar and its annoying me so so much
- navigationalbar.html like our demo file to check things
- index.html maybe two buttons client or admin??
- raiders.php not centered

- move things in aboutus into center
- help at bottom of page take out t@cs
- LogOut button issues? cant move it more to the left, not displaying
-in adminnewbooking clientID should be ordered in ascending

-adminnewbookingpage query for assign drivers and assign vehicles 
-driver homepage should only show the specific schedule for the driver not for all of them 
-maybe have one employees table that stores all the data about each employee and their password for the logging in pages
 with a system like:
  A01-administrators
  DR01 - DR10 for drivers
  DA01 - depot admin
  HR01 - hr manager???
- flow from driver login page, driver homepage, driver depot page should all contain an id
-driver should click check availability and that should send to depotadmins who confirm and then send back confirmation msg to drivers
- maybe notification tab in drivers?

- The global navigation buttons go to admin/client pages depending on which page you click them on,
  shouldnt it stay in admin/client?
- The logout button only works on 1 size of screen, need to align it to the right side of the screen
  on all pages.

----------DATABASE------------

-in vehicles licensecode musn't be unique, must allow for duplicate values
-shouldnt be a tripnumber column in depot database
-add end location/multiple locations to bookings
-still need driverlicense class
