- i dont think the clients booking (where the client enters their info) page needs a navigation bar
- there is a little gap between to the left of the navigation bar and its annoying me so so much
- navigationalbar.html like our demo file to check things
- index.html maybe two buttons client or admin??
- raiders.php not centered

- doesn't make sense the table on returning and new client page because the driver wont be assigned and stuff 
- after you logged out and redirected to the raiders.php page maybe something at the top saying sucessfully logged out?
- why doesn't the id code for the clienttable same thing with the logout button 
(see navigation.html for further explanation) not want to be called from the external style sheet??
- right align copyright
- returningandnewclients.php booking id would be passed into the legend of the fieldset
- move things in aboutus into center
- help at bottom of page take out t@cs
- LogOut button issues? cant move it more to the left, not displaying
-in adminnewbooking clientID should be ordered in ascending


Liam
- The global navigation buttons go to admin/client pages depending on which page you click them on,
  shouldnt it stay in admin/client?
- The logout button only works on 1 size of screen, need to align it to the right side of the screen
  on all pages.

----------DATABASE------------

- firstName needs to be fixed
- "client" needs to be "clients"
- daytrip needs to be "daytrips"
- need to add the remaining databases
  - vehicleBooking
  - vehicle
  - license
  - driverLicense
- confirm with ERD that all collumns are there

DONE
- maybe calling the bookingreq.php page homepage would make more sense
- why have a search bar what will it do - deleted
- when you click bookings now takes you too the adminNewBookingPage that Liam created
- why client.php task bar different
- maybe a reports tab?
