- move things in aboutus into center
- help at bottom of page take out t@cs
- LogOut button issues? cant move it more to the left, not displaying

-in adminnewbooking clientID should be ordered in ascending
-adminnewbookingpage query for assign drivers and assign vehicles 

-driver homepage should only show the specific schedule for the driver not for all of them 
-maybe have one employees table that stores all the data about each employee and their password for the logging in pages
 with a system like:
  A01 - administrators
  DR01 - DR10 for drivers
  DA01 - depot admin
  HR01 - hr manager???
- flow from driver login page, driver homepage, driver depot page should all contain an id
-driver should click check availability and that should send to depotadmins who confirm and then send back confirmation msg to drivers
- maybe notification tab in drivers? 
-all logout buttons should go back to where you choose what kind of employee one is
-all drivers not showing up in adminnewbooking

- The logout button only works on 1 size of screen, need to align it to the right side of the screen
  on all pages.
- Add a limit to the booking request page to limit the max number of passengers

----------DATABASE------------

-in vehicles licensecode musn't be unique, must allow for duplicate values
-in vehicleBooking, driverID and vehicleID must allow for duplicate values
-shouldnt be a tripnumber column in depot database
-add end location/multiple locations to bookings
-still need driverlicense class
