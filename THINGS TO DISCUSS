- i dont think the clients booking (where the client enters their info) page needs a navigation bar
- maybe calling the bookingreq.php page homepage would make more sense
- there is a little gap between to the left of the navigation bar and its annoying me so so much
- navigationalbar.html like our demo file to check things
- index.html maybe two buttons client or admin??
- can delete stylesheet.css
