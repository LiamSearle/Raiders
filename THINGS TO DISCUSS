- i dont think the clients booking (where the client enters their info) page needs a navigation bar
- maybe calling the bookingreq.php page homepage would make more sense
- there is a little gap between to the left of the navigation bar and its annoying me so so much
- navigationalbar.html like our demo file to check things
- index.html maybe two buttons client or admin??
- raiders.php not centered
- why have a search bar what will it do?
- client tab should go to returningAndNewClient.php
- LogOut button issues? cant move it more to the left
- doesn't make sense the table on returning and new client page because the driver wont be assigned and stuff 
- when you click bookings now takes you too the adminNewBookingPage that Liam created
- after you logged out and redirected to the raiders.php page maybe something at the top saying sucessfully logged out?
- why doesn't the id code for the clienttable same thing with the logout button 
(see navigation.html for further explanation) not want to be called from the external style sheet??
- maybe a reports tab?
- returningandnewclients.php booking id would be passed into the legend of the fieldset


 <td><div class="button">
                    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Log Out" onclick="logOut();">
                    </div></td>
